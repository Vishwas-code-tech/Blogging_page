        Being a perfect man is not about having flawless looks or wealth, but
        about building strong character, showing respect, and striving for
        personal growth. A perfect man is honest, kind, responsible, and treats
        others with fairness and compassion. He knows his strengths but stays
        humble, and he learns from his mistakes instead of hiding them. He takes
        care of his family and supports others without expecting anything in
        return. He communicates with confidence, listens with patience, and
        stands up for what is right. While perfection may not be truly
        achievable, striving to be the best version of oneself every day is what
        truly defines a perfect man.Being a perfect man is not about having
