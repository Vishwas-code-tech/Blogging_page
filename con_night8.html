        The night was darker than usual, with thick clouds hiding the moon and
        stars, casting the world into a shadowy silence. The wind whispered
        through the trees, carrying an eerie chill that crept under the skin.
        Somewhere in the distance, a lone owl hooted, breaking the heavy
        stillness. In the dim glow of a flickering streetlight, a figure moved
        slowly down the empty road, footsteps echoing like distant thunder.
        Every sound seemed louder, every shadow seemed alive. It was the kind of
        night where secrets hid in the darkness and fear walked hand in hand
        with silence. Something about the air felt wrong—like the night was
        holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.The night was darker
