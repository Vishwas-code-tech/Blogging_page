        To make the most of your day before an exam, it's important to follow a
        structured timetable. Start your day early around 7:00 AM, freshen up,
        and have a light, healthy breakfast. Begin your first study session at
        8:00 AM, focusing on the most important or difficult topic. After two
        hours of focused studying, take a 15-minute break to stretch and relax.
        From 10:15 AM to 12:15 PM, study another major topic or continue
        reviewing important notes. Take a longer break for lunch around 12:15 PM
        and give yourself time to relax. Resume studying at 1:00 PM with a
        90-minute session, focusing on a third topic or revising notes. After a
        short break at 2:30 PM, start a practice session from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM
        to test your knowledge with questions or flashcards. Follow it with a
        light snack and rest. In the evening, from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, go over
        any weak areas or confusing concepts. Have dinner around 6:00 PM and
        relax your mind. From 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM, do a quick recap of all the
        topics studied, using summaries or flashcards. Take time to unwind, and
        around 9:00 PM, do some light review if needed. Aim to sleep by 10:00 PM
        to stay well-rested and alert for your exam. Let me know if you'd like a
        version for night owls or for someone with limited time! To make the
